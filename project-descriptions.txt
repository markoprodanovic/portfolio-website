Yuki Postal Service (YPS)

YPS is a retro album tracking service created for New Zealand based musician (and close friend) Yuki. It was designed to mimic the postal tracking services of the mid-200s and was meant to build excitement around Yuki's album release. YPS doubles as a music streamer, providing fans samples of Yuki's music.
